**rpgsupportbot**

Chatbot Project in Python

for now my personal goals are:

1. run on Discord (discord API as documented her: https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs)
2. roll dice to the chat
3. learn about test driven development
4. learn about and try a more complex project structure (pseudocomplexity on purpose)
5. at least get the diceroller ready in january ;)

------------

Modules i managed to do so sloppy i am restructuring it completely on a test basis:

- helpmsg
- diceroll

------------

- redo code structure
- write the tests
- create sensible packages

------------


Greetings
